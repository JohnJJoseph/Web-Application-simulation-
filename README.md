#🔐 Web Application Security Testing – Penetration Testing Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on practical Web Application Penetration Testing to identify, exploit, and document common security vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools and methodologies.
The testing was conducted in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux, targeting intentionally vulnerable applications such as DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) and testphp.vulnweb.com 



The goal of this project is to understand real-world attack techniques and highlight the importance of secure development practices.

🎯 Objectives

Implement standard phases of penetration testing

Identify vulnerabilities in web applications

Exploit vulnerabilities in a safe lab environment

Document findings and recommend remediation

Gain hands-on experience with professional security tools



🧪 Testing Methodology

The project follows a 5-Phase Penetration Testing Model:

Reconnaissance – Information gathering (WHOIS, DNS, tech stack)

Scanning & Enumeration – Port scans, directory brute force, service detection

Vulnerability Assessment – Mapping issues to OWASP Top 10

Exploitation – Practical attacks and proof of concept

Reporting & Remediation – Documentation and fix recommendations


🛠️ Tools Used

🚨 Vulnerabilities Identified

The following vulnerabilities were successfully identified and exploited:

✅ SQL Injection (SQLi)

✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — Reflected, Stored, DOM

✅ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

✅ Brute Force Login Attacks

✅ Security Misconfigurations

✅ Directory Listing & Sensitive File Exposure

✅ Missing Security Headers

All vulnerabilities were mapped to OWASP Top 10 categories and verified through exploitation.

💥 Exploitation Highlights
🔓 SQL Injection

Enumerated databases using SQLMap

Extracted sensitive data from backend tables

Demonstrated full database compromise

🔁 CSRF

Password changed without user consent

Token bypass using combined vulnerabilities

🧨 XSS

Cookie stealing via DOM-based scripts

Persistent payloads using stored XSS

🔐 Brute Force

Successful login using Burp Intruder

No rate limiting or lockout protection

Web_report_john

🔧 Remediation Recommendations

Use prepared statements / parameterized queries to prevent SQLi

Implement CSRF tokens with strict validation

Apply input validation and output encoding to stop XSS

Disable directory indexing on web servers

Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

Enable rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms

Keep all software and dependencies up to date
